The numbers to the left of the file names in the table are sheet numbers.
The source code has been printed in a double column format with fifty
lines per column, giving one hundred lines per sheet (or page).
Thus there is a convenient relationship between line numbers and sheet numbers.

The source listing is preceded by a cross-reference that lists every defined 
constant, struct, global variable, and function in xv6.  Each entry gives,
on the same line as the name, the line number (or, in a few cases, numbers)
where the name is defined.  Successive lines in an entry list the line
numbers where the name is used.  For example, this entry:

    swtch 2658
        0374 2428 2466 2657 2658

indicates that swtch is defined on line 2658 and is mentioned on five lines
on sheets 03, 24, and 26.
